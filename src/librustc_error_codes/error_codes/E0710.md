An unknown tool name found in scoped lint

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0710
#[allow(clipp::filter_map)] // error: an unknown tool name found in scoped lint: `clipp::filter_map`
fn main() {
    /**
    *business logic
    */
}
```

Please verify you didn't misspell the tool's name or that you didn't
forget to import it in you project:

```
#[allow(clippy::filter_map)] // ok!
fn main() {
    /**
    *business logic
    */
}
```
