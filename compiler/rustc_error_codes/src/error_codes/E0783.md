The range pattern `...` is no longer allowed.

Older Rust code using previous editions allowed `...` to stand for exclusive
ranges which are now signified using `..=`.

The following code use to compile, but now it now longer does.

```no_run
fn main() {
    let n = 2u8;
    match n {
        ...9 => println!("Got a number less than 10"),
        _ => println!("Got a number 10 or more")
    }
}
```

To make this code compile replace the `...` with `..=`.
