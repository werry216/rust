An underscore `_` character or a numeric literal `u8`, `i32`, `f64`, etc has
been used as the identifier for a lifetime. 

Erroneous code example 1:
```
fn some_function<'_>(str1: &'_ str, str2: &'_ str) -> &'_ str {
    //Some code
}
```
or Erroneous code example 2:
```
fn some_function<'u8>(str1: &'u8 str, str2: &'u8 str) -> &'u8 str {
    //Some code
}
```

Lifetimes are named with `'ident`, where ident is the name of the lifetime or
loop. The `_` character, which represents the ignore pattern, cannot be used
as the identifier because it is a reserved lifetime name. Numeric literals are
also invalid lifetime identifiers and will cause this error to be thrown. To fix
this, use a series of lowercase letters as the lifetime identifier. Often a
single lowercase letter, such as `'a`, is sufficient.  For more information, see
[the book][bk-no].

Corrected code example:
```
fn some_function<'a>(str1: &'a str, str2: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    //Some code
}
```
