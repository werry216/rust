LL |     let strings: [String; 5] = [String::new(); 5];
   |                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `Copy` is not implemented for `String`
   |
   = note: the `Copy` trait is required because the repeated element will be copied
   = help: create an inline `const` block, see PR #2920 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2920> for more information
