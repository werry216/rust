Trait objects must include the `dyn` keyword.

Trait objects are a way to call methods on types that are not known until
runtime but conform to some trait.

In the following code the trait object should be formed with
`Box<dyn Foo>`, but `dyn` is left off.

```no_run
trait Foo {}
fn test(arg: Box<Foo>) {}
```

This makes it harder to see that `arg` is a trait object and not a
simply a heap allocated type called `Foo`.

This used to be allowed before edition 2021, but is now an error.
