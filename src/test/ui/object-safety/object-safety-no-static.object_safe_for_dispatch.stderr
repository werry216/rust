   = help: consider turning `foo` into a method by giving it a `&self` argument or constraining it with `where Self: Sized`
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `std::ops::CoerceUnsized<std::boxed::Box<dyn Foo>>` for `std::boxed::Box<Bar>`
   = note: required by cast to type `std::boxed::Box<dyn Foo>`
