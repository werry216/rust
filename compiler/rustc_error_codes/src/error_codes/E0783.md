The range pattern `...` is no longer allowed.

Erroneous code example:

```edition2021,compile_fail,E782
fn main() {
    match 2u8 {
        0...9 => println!("Got a number less than 10"),
        _ => println!("Got a number 10 or more")
    }
}
```

Older Rust code using previous editions allowed `...` to stand for exclusive
ranges which are now signified using `..=`.

To make this code compile replace the `...` with `..=`.

```
fn main() {
    match 2u8 {
        0..=9 => println!("Got a number less than 10"),
        _ => println!("Got a number 10 or more")
    }
}
```
