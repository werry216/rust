error: pointers cannot be compared in a meaningful way during const eval.

   = note: It is conceptually impossible for const eval to know in all cases whether two pointers are equal. While sometimes it is clear (the address of a static item is never equal to the address of another static item), comparing an integer address with any allocation's address is impossible to do at compile-time.
   = note: That said, there's the `ptr_maybe_eq` intrinsic which returns `true` for all comparisons where CTFE isn't sure whether two addresses are equal. The mirror intrinsic `ptr_maybe_ne` returns `true` for all comparisons where CTFE isn't sure whether two addresses are inequal.

error: aborting due to previous error
