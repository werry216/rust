The underscore `_` character has been used as the identifier for a lifetime. 

Erroneous code example:
```
fn some_function<'_>(x: &'_ str, y: &'_ str) -> &'_ str {
    //Some code
}
```

Lifetimes are named with 'ident, where ident is the name of the 
lifetime or loop. The `_` character, which represents the ignore pattern, 
cannot be used because it is a reserved lifetime name. 
To fix this, use a single lowercase letter as the 
lifetime identifier, such as `'a`. For more information, see [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/appendix-02-operators.html#non-operator-symbols).

Corrected code example:
```
fn some_function<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    //Some code
}
```
