//! This module provides utilities to handle C-like strings.  It is
//! mainly of use for FFI (Foreign Function Interface) bindings and
//! code that needs to exchange C-like strings with other languages.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Rust represents owned strings with the [`String`] type, and
//! borrowed slices of strings with the [`str`] primitive.  Both are
//! always in UTF-8 encoding, and may contain nul bytes in the middle,
//! i.e. if you look at the bytes that make up the string, there may
//! be a `0` among them.  Both `String` and `str` know their length;
//! there are no nul terminators at the end of strings like in C.
//!
//! C strings are different from Rust strings:
//!
//! * **Encodings** - C strings may have different encodings.  If
//! you are bringing in strings from C APIs, you should check what
//! encoding you are getting.  Rust strings are always UTF-8.
//!
//! * **Character width** - C strings may use "normal" or "wide"
//! characters, i.e. `char` or `wchar_t`, respectively.  The C
//! standard leaves the actual sizes of those types open to
//! interpretation, but defines different APIs for strings made up of
//! each character type.  Rust strings are always UTF-8, so different
//! Unicode characters will be encoded in a variable number of bytes
//! each.  The Rust type [`char`] represents a '[Unicode
//! scalar value]', which is similar to, but not the same as, a
//! '[Unicode code point]'.
//!
//! * **Nul terminators and implicit string lengths** - Often, C
//! strings are nul-terminated, i.e. they have a `0` character at the
//! end.  The length of a string buffer is not known *a priori*;
//! instead, to compute the length of a string, C code must manually
//! call a function like `strlen()` for `char`-based strings, or
//! `wcslen()` for `wchar_t`-based ones.  Those functions return the
//! number of characters in the string excluding the nul terminator,
//! so the buffer length is really `len+1` characters.  Rust strings
//! don't have a nul terminator, and they always know their length.
//!
//! * **No nul characters in the middle of the string** - When C
//! strings have a nul terminator character, this usually means that
//! they cannot have nul characters in the middle — a nul character
//! would essentially truncate the string.  Rust strings *can* have
//! nul characters in the middle, since they don't use nul
//! terminators.
//!
//! # Representations of non-Rust strings
//!
//! [`CString`] and [`CStr`] are useful when you need to transfer
//! UTF-8 strings to and from C, respectively:
//!
//! * **From Rust to C:** [`CString`] represents an owned, C-friendly
//! UTF-8 string:  it is valid UTF-8, it is nul-terminated, and has no
//! nul characters in the middle.  Rust code can create a `CString`
//! out of a normal string (provided that the string doesn't have nul
//! characters in the middle), and then use a variety of methods to
//! obtain a raw `*mut u8` that can then be passed as an argument to C
//! functions.
//!
//! * **From C to Rust:** [`CStr`] represents a borrowed C string; it
//! is what you would use to wrap a raw `*const u8` that you got from
//! a C function.  A `CStr` is just guaranteed to be a nul-terminated
//! array of bytes; the UTF-8 validation step only happens when you
//! request to convert it to a `&str`.
//!
//! [`OsString`] and [`OsStr`] are useful when you need to transfer
//! strings to and from operating system calls.  If you need Rust
//! strings out of them, they can take care of conversion to and from
//! the operating system's preferred form for strings — of course, it
//! may not be possible to convert all valid operating system strings
//! into valid UTF-8; the `OsString` and `OsStr` functions let you know
//! when this is the case.
//!
//! * [`OsString`] represents an owned string in whatever
//! representation the operating system prefers.  In the Rust standard
//! library, various APIs that transfer strings to/from the operating
//! system use `OsString` instead of plain strings.  For example,
//! [`env::var_os()`] is used to query environment variables; it
//! returns an `Option<OsString>`.  If the environment variable exists
//! you will get a `Some(os_string)`, which you can *then* try to
//! convert to a Rust string.  This yields a [`Result<>`], so that
//! your code can detect errors in case the environment variable did
//! not in fact contain valid Unicode data.
//!
//! * [`OsStr`] represents a borrowed reference to a string in a
//! format that can be passed to the operating system.  It can be
//! converted into an UTF-8 Rust string slice in a similar way to
//! `OsString`.
//!
//! # Conversions
//!
//! ## On Unix
//!
//! On Unix, [`OsStr`] implements the `std::os::unix:ffi::`[`OsStrExt`][unix.OsStrExt] trait, which
//! augments it with two methods, [`from_bytes`] and [`as_bytes`].  These do inexpensive conversions
//! from and to UTF-8 byte slices.
//!
//! Additionally, on Unix [`OsString`] implements the
//! `std::os::unix:ffi::`[`OsStringExt`][unix.OsStringExt] trait,
//! which provides [`from_vec`] and [`into_vec`] methods that consume
//! their arguments, and take or produce vectors of [`u8`].
//!
//! ## On Windows
//!
//! On Windows, [`OsStr`] implements the `std::os::windows::ffi::`[`OsStrExt`][windows.OsStrExt]
//! trait, which provides an [`encode_wide`] method.  This provides an iterator that can be
//! [`collect`]ed into a vector of [`u16`].
//!
//! Additionally, on Windows [`OsString`] implements the
//! `std::os::windows:ffi::`[`OsStringExt`][windows.OsStringExt] trait, which provides a
//! [`from_wide`] method.  The result of this method is an `OsString` which can be round-tripped to
//! a Windows string losslessly.
