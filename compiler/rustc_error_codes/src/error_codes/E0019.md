A function call isn't allowed in the const's initialization expression
because the expression's value must be known at compile-time.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0019
#![feature(asm)]

fn main() {
    static STATIC11: i32 = {
        let x: i32;
        unsafe { asm!("mov rax, 2", out("rax") x) }; // error!
        x
    };
}
```

Remember: you can't use a function call inside a const's initialization
expression! However, you can totally use it anywhere else:

```
enum Test {
    V1
}

impl Test {
    fn func(&self) -> i32 {
        12
    }
}

fn main() {
    const FOO: Test = Test::V1;

    FOO.func(); // here is good
    let x = FOO.func(); // or even here!
}
```
