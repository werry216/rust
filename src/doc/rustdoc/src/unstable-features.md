# Unstable features

Rustdoc is under active developement, and like the Rust compiler, some features are only available
on the nightly releases. Some of these are new and need some more testing before they're able to get
released to the world at large, and some of them are tied to features in the Rust compiler that are
themselves unstable. Several features here require a matching `#![feature(...)]` attribute to
enable, and thus are more fully documented in the [Unstable Book]. Those sections will link over
there as necessary.
