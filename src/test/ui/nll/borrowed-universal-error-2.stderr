error[E0597]: `v` does not live long enough

LL | fn foo<'a>(x: &'a (u32,)) -> &'a u32 {

LL |     let v = 22;
LL |     &v
   |     ^^ `v` would have to be valid for `'a`
LL |     //~^ ERROR `v` does not live long enough [E0597]
LL | }
   | - ...but `v` is only valid for the duration of the `foo` function, so it is dropped here while still borrowed
