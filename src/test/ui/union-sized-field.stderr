14 |     value: T,
   |     ^^^^^^^^ `T` does not have a constant size known at compile-time

   = help: the trait `std::marker::Sized` is not implemented for `T`
   = help: consider adding a `where T: std::marker::Sized` bound
   = note: only the last field of a struct or an union may have a dynamically sized type
