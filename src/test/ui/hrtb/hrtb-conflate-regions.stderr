error: implementation of `Foo` is not general enough

   = note: Due to a where-clause on `want_foo2`,
   = note: `Foo<(&'0 isize, &'1 isize)>` would have to be implemented for the type `SomeStruct`, for any two lifetimes `'0` and `'1`
   = note: but `Foo<(&'2 isize, &'2 isize)>` is actually implemented for the type `SomeStruct`, for some lifetime `'2`

error: aborting due to previous error
