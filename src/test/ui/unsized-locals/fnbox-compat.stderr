   = note: `std::ops::FnOnce<(&'0 i32,)>` would have to be implemented for the type `std::boxed::Box<(dyn for<'r> std::boxed::FnBox<(&'r i32,), Output=T> + 'static)>`, for some specific lifetime `'0`
   = note: but `std::ops::FnOnce<(&'1 i32,)>` is actually implemented for the type `std::boxed::Box<(dyn std::boxed::FnBox<(&'1 i32,), Output=T> + '_)>`, for some specific lifetime `'1`
